// The order of class initialization, as defined by JavaScript, is:

//     The base class fields are initialized
//     The base class constructor runs
//     The derived class fields are initialized
//     The derived class constructor runs

// This means that the base class constructor saw its own value for name during its own constructor,
// because the derived class field initializations hadnâ€™t run yet.
